# Travel Agency Site

Hi! This is a project developed with the intention to studying the basis of web development with HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript.

Nice things that I learned from this project:

- Flexbox concepts
	- I covered the basics of flexbox, like: flex-direction, justify-content and align-items.
- How to integrate with google maps
	- The site contact section uses a map to show the address, for that I used Google Maps integration and documentation.
- Media queries
	- All the site is responsive for smartphones, tablet and desktop.
